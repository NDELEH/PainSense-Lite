# PainSense-Lite: A Minimalist Chronic Pain Monitoring System
# PainSense-Lite

## Introduction
PainSense-Lite is a **proof-of-concept project** for a real-time chronic pain monitoring system. It uses synthetic biometric data and a basic machine learning model to simulate pain detection and provide real-time alerts.

## Features
- **Synthetic Biometric Data**: Simulates heart rate, skin conductance, and muscle tension.
- **Pain Prediction Model**: Uses a Random Forest classifier to predict pain based on biometric data.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Simulates real-time pain detection and provides alerts.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/PainSense-Lite.git
